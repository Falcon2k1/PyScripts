# PyScripts
Personal Scripts I've written for various things.

# Notes
Some of this info involves some secrets so there's a non sync'd secrets folder I use for this. In case you're wanting to replicate this, make a secrets subfolder under this directory and include a blank file named \_\_init\_\_.py to show python it can use it as an import source.

# Descriptions - Usable
## Daily_report_builder.py
Used to automate a report that involves several screenshots, one after the other.

## Impacts_Assemble.py
For my job I sometimes have to get a nonformatted list of entries from a website; I built this script in order to automate that process and save myself a lot of tedious manual notepad work. It copies from/to the clipboard to make it easier to manage.

## mouse_pos_getter.py
Used as a diagnostic script for building PyAutoGUI scripts. Not fancy, just continuously shows the current x/y coords.

## PyPing_native.py
My first major script! It opens a console window and pings to whatever you have targeted, then saves the results as {target}.txt. A . in the console window is a successful call, and a ! is a failure. 

## PyPing.py
Another implementation, using a module to ping instead of running the Ping command.

## Trace_stripper.py
I don't remember what this does; I think I used it to interpret traceroute info.

# Descriptions - Unusable
## Erannorth Affinity / Import
WIP, not functional. Used as a starting point to determine which races/classes/specialties in Erannorth worked well together.

## Game Sync
WIP, not functional. Used to sync stuff between two remote computers I have access to for games that don't use Steam Cloud Sync.

## GSheets functions / getDesc
WIP, not functional. Used when I was trying to modify a huge amount of data for a D&D application I was building.
